# Lessons — sshd-cli

Durable failure modes. **Always re-check on product review.**

| ID | Mode | Prevention | Status |
|----|------|------------|--------|
| L-TYPE-N-01 | TTY empty argv accidentally becomes install-ensure (menu split lost) | `requirement-shell-cli-zero-arguments` TTY menu / non-TTY Type O; TP-CLI-07 **and** TP-CLI-14 | open watch |
| L-ONLINE-01 | Channel env advertised as a verb, or `CHECKSUM` on help/about | `SCRIPT_URL` is a channel env (not a command); TP-CLI-04/10; TP-CSUM-01 | open watch |
| L-UNIN-01 | Non-interactive uninstall succeeds without force | TP-LC-05 confirm fail-closed | open watch |
| L-INST-MODE-01 | Install leaves `0711`/`0700` (chmod +x after mktemp) so non-owners cannot run shell ship unit | absolute `chmod 0755` + heal on reinstall; TP-LC-09/10; local-self-management §2.3.1 | open watch |
| L-TRIM-01 | Backup / restore / sudoers verbs reintroduced as if still product law | bootstrap-chain (absent domain); TP-CLI-04/13 | open watch |
| L-PUSH-VAULT-01 | Bare `git push` uses wrong active SSH vault when default face ≠ repository-user | Pre-git report + bound SSH transport; incident 20260810-001 | open watch |
| L-SETU-01 | `set -u` crash with unset HOME | TP-CLI-11 | open watch |
| L-STOR-01 | Shared world-writable storage | util_resolve_storage; TP-CLI-12 | open watch |
| L-INTENT-01 | Harness Type 0 / “don’t wrap package managers” overrode a clear Termux sshd purpose; `pkg` listed as a domain non-goal until the operator named packages | Purpose wins: specialize **`LM-SHELL-TERMUX-ISH`** / `requirement-shell-termux-ish`; bootstrap Step 5c; domain Protection Rule 8b; Linux `apt` stays out; TP-LC-15/16 | open watch |
| L-ERR-HOST-01 | POSIX Linux start/stop fail-closed copy hardcoded “use Termux” as a next step on a host that is not Termux | Next step is host-local (Linux: re-run as root); do not name another platform after detect; **INC-20260908-001**; `CL-OPERATOR-READABLE-ERROR` E3 | open watch |
| L-DNS-01 | TTY Host pick reused main-menu Exit `9` on an unbounded list | Leave with `0` / empty; TP-DNS-13 | open watch |
| L-DNS-02 | `dns add` appended after trailing `Host *` so OpenSSH first-match ignored new User/Port | Insert before first wildcard Host / Match; atomic replace; TP-DNS-14 | open watch |
| L-DNS-03 | `Key=value` / extra Host aliases lost on set | Parse optional `=`; keep aliases after first pattern; TP-DNS-15/16 | open watch |
| L-DNS-04 | TTY main menu omitted `dns` so an update-and-open looked like the Host list was never added | Number `dns` as row 5; TP-CLI-14 · TP-DNS-20 | open watch |
| L-DNS-05 | TTY Host list treated a number as update-only; no add/delete | Action menu Edit/Add/Delete then Host pick; TP-DNS-20..24 | open watch |

**Related-product only (do not re-apply as this origin’s law):** L-DEPOSIT-01, L-SUDOERS-01..05, L-OVERWRITE-01 stay on folder-backup. Type O empty-argv / online-channel lessons stay on products that own those surfaces. This product is hop 0.

**This origin’s kept surfaces:** output SSOT, no basename gate on entry, storage isolation, Type N empty argv.
